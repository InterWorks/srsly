What is this?
-------------

jsWorks is a loose bundle of JavaScript goodness put together by the fine folks at InterWorks.

This isn't framework. Some parts do have dependencies but for the most part it is designed such
that you can simply take what you want and ignore the rest.

It rocks and it's free so treat yourself to some JS love, on us.


What's included?
----------------

  -  **GridView**: <table/> + data store + DataPager = wicked grid action.
  -  **LocalDataStore**: Data store that provides an interface for retrieving filtered & sorted data from an array of data.
  -  **RemoteDataStore**: Data store that provides an interface for retrieving filtered & sorted data from a remote URL.
  -  **DataPager**: Implements paging logic over a data store.
  -  **Event**: Dead simple way to add custom events to your objects.
